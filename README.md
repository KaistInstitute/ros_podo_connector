# ros_podo_connector overview

ros_podo_connector provides a ROS interface specifically for generating motion for the Mobile
Hubo Platform developed by KAIST Hubo Lab.
The API utilizes standard ROS actionlib package to control robot's base, arm, and gripper
motion. This interface abstracts the low-level control implemented in the custom real-time
PODO software, such as trajectory and IK solvers, and hence allows developers to focus on
high-level task planning for more complex sequence of behaviors
